# Galaxy-Game
A multi-platform game made using python and kivy library

The Galaxy Game is a complete game with randomized land generation algorithm, perspective vision, linear difficulty rise, and much more.
It boasts a 60 FPS gameplay, great audio effects, and beautiful graphics.

Anyone can download the code and run it to play the game, provided they have the kivy libraries installed.
I will soon pack it into a one-click install game or provide the librabries in the package itself.

The idea of this game and the guidance was given by Mr. Jonathan Roux in the course provided by freeCodeCamp.org.
